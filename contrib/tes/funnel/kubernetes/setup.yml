# Combined YAML for all Funnel components for testing Toil against on UCSC's Kubernetes cluster.
# Adapted from: https://github.com/ohsu-comp-bio/funnel/tree/master/deployments/kubernetes
#
# This sets up Funnel with basic authentication as
# "toil"/"basic_auth_password", under a "toil-svc" service account (which you
# may need to change for your cluster). It will run TES tasks as Kubernetes
# Jobs in the "toil" namespace. Docker images used in TES tasks will be fetched
# through a Docker Hub mirror at http://docker-registry.toil.
#
# To deploy with a secure password that is a valid quoted YAML string (i.e.
# does not contain ") (which can still be stolen from your local machine with
# ps while you do it):
#
#   sed 's/basic_auth_password/your_real_password/g' setup.yml | kubectl apply -f -
#
# You can use this command to expose the server on your local machine's
# loopback interface:
#
#   kubectl port-forward service/funnel 8000:8000

# First we need a Service (of the default Cluster IP type)
# Since we have no auth, make sure not to expose this to the Internet!
